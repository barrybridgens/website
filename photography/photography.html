		<p>Photography has been my main hobby for a number of years. I have been a member of photography clubs at work and I am an active member of the flickr community</p>
		<p>Although I now mainly use digital cameras, I still own, and sometimes use, a number of film cameras. I also own a selection of darkroom equipment that I am always planning to use again but never quite get around to it! See the link above for more details of my camera equipment</p>
		<p>I enjoy all types of photography and try, not always successfully, to take photographs regularly. See the link above for examples of my photographs</p>
